        <p>A smart home system that tries to do the right thing, but is more a nuisance than a help.</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The punishing home is a smart home project that aims to see people how much they rely on technology for their daily lives. in this project we made a smart home system that tries to give the ideal environment, but annoys the person and gets in their way.</p>
        <p>the project is build from the ground up and is a amalgamation of various technologies including sensors, actuators, machine learning, speech to text and python.</p>
        <p>I made the code for the text to speech system, research which was used in the project, together with a colleague the face for the product and research.</p>

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>For the studio named Dark Tech we got the assignment named Smart Home: Punishing Home, this meant we had to make a product that simulates a smart home setting. but we had to look at how much damage it would cause if, the home system wouldn't help you but force you to listen to his commands or else it would sabotage you. </p>
